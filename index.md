## About Me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Operations Research program at <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech ISyE</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen">Xin Chen</a>. I got an M.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I worked closely with Prof. <a href="https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/">Lek-Heng Lim</a>. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Information and Computing Science from Sun Yat-sen University.
